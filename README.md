# examples-javascript

This repository contains Javascript code examples using the MoneyMoov API. The examples are written to operate in the [NoFrixion sandbox environment](https://docs.nofrixion.com/reference/sandbox).

Each subfolder contains examples of the methods associated with a particular endpoint.

We will continue adding examples as the API develops.
